# Using `llms.txt` for Hyper-Personalized YC Outreach

This repository showcases **WhiteContext's** system for generating hyper-personalized outreach messages at scale. We leverage our `llms.txt` data format and Large Language Models (LLMs) to connect meaningfully with YC founders and other valuable contacts.

## What is `llms.txt`?

An `llms.txt` file is a standardized, AI-consumable text representation of a website's content. It's generated by our proprietary "Visual Mining" process, which intelligently extracts and synthesizes key information about a company or product.

The core of an `llms.txt` file is its **`SYNTHESIZED OVERVIEW`**, which typically includes:
*   **Website Purpose & Audience:** Who the company serves and why.
*   **Core Offerings/Products:** What they sell or provide.
*   **Key Content Sections:** How their information is structured.
*   **Notable Features/Interactions:** Unique aspects and functionalities.

This structured overview provides deep, relevant, and token-efficient context about any company, crucial for genuine personalization.
You can see examples of `llms.txt` files:
*   For target YC companies in the `output_llms/` directory (e.g., `output_llms/airweave_ai_llms.txt`).
*   For a detailed VC analysis in `inovo/inovo_vc_llms.txt`.

## Our Outreach Personalization Workflow

Our system transforms website intelligence into highly relevant outreach messages in four steps:

1.  **Context Extraction (`llms.txt` Generation):**
    *   For each target company (e.g., a YC founder's startup), we generate a dedicated `llms.txt` file.
    *   The `SYNTHESIZED OVERVIEW` within this file provides the core intelligence about the target.

2.  **Intelligence Aggregation (`ai_founders_with_llms.csv`):**
    *   Key details from these `llms.txt` files, especially the `llms_txt_overview` for numerous target YC founders, are compiled into `ai_founders_with_llms.csv`. This creates a structured database of insights.

3.  **LLM-Powered Personalization (`llm-gemini.py`):**
    *   Our Python script, `llm-gemini.py`, utilizes the Google Gemini API.
    *   **Inputs:**
        *   The target company's `llms_txt_overview` (from `ai_founders_with_llms.csv`).
        *   WhiteContext's own company overview (`whitecontext_llms.txt`) to provide context about us.
        *   Founder's details (name, company).
    *   **Process:** The LLM is prompted to draft:
        *   A concise LinkedIn connection request (strictly ‚â§160 characters).
        *   A short follow-up message (strictly ‚â§40 words) proposing a public showcase of how WhiteContext's technology can integrate with and benefit the founder's company.
    *   The prompt ensures messages reference specific, concrete elements from *both* the target's overview and WhiteContext's overview, fostering genuine connection.

4.  **Personalized Outreach Ready (`yc_founders_whitecontext_outreach.csv`):**
    *   The script outputs `yc_founders_whitecontext_outreach.csv`. This file contains the tailored `connection_request` and `follow_up_message` for each founder, ready for outreach campaigns. It also flags any messages that might have violated length constraints for review.

## Why This Matters (Benefits)

This system provides:

*   ‚úÖ **Deep Personalization:** Messages resonate by referencing specific company details and potential synergies, far surpassing generic templates.
*   üöÄ **Scalability:** Automates the time-consuming research and bespoke message drafting process for hundreds of founders.
*   ‚è±Ô∏è **Efficiency:** Drastically reduces manual outreach effort, allowing our team to connect meaningfully with a broader and more relevant set of YC companies.
*   üìà **Data-Driven:** Ensures outreach is based on a structured, AI-enhanced understanding of each company.
*   ü§ù **High-Quality Interactions:** Sets the stage for more productive conversations by demonstrating genuine interest and understanding from the first touchpoint.

## Explore the Showcase

The files in this repository demonstrate the end-to-end process:

*   **`llms.txt` Examples (Input Intelligence):**
    *   `output_llms/`: Contains `llms.txt` overviews for various YC companies.
    *   `inovo/inovo_vc_llms.txt`: A detailed `llms.txt` for a venture capital firm, showing depth of analysis.
*   **Our Context (Who We Are):**
    *   `whitecontext_llms.txt`: The `llms.txt` for WhiteContext, used by the LLM for self-reference during message generation.
*   **The Engine & Data:**
    *   `ai_founders_with_llms.csv`: The input CSV aggregating `llms_txt_overview` data for target founders.
    *   `llm-gemini.py`: The Python script that orchestrates the LLM-based message generation.
*   **The Result (Personalized Messages):**
    *   `yc_founders_whitecontext_outreach.csv`: The output CSV containing the final personalized outreach messages for YC founders.
